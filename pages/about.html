							<h1>About Me</h1>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>I am a Master's student in Management Science and Engineering at Stanford. My official track is Technology and Engineering
							Management. Through this track, I have been able to take really cool classes on how stock markets work, how technology companies have set their strategies,
							hands on entrepreneurship class that led to Verix and a deep learning class by Andrew Ng which has by far been my favorite class at Stanford.</p>

							<p>Apart from a lot of in school learning, I did an internship in Product Management last summer at ServiceNow. It was an incredible experience
							in terms of all the different things that I got to do ranging from analytics to UX to strategy. During this internship, I grew a lot not only professionally but also personally 
							and this internship reinforced my interest in product management. </p>

							<p>Before I came to Stanford, I worked as a Software Engineer at Visa in Bangalore, India with some of the smartest people I know building really useful products. I joined Visa after graduating form
							Indian Institute of Technology, Guwahati with a Bachelor's in Electrical Engineering. In my junior year at IIT Guwahati, I learnt the beauty of applied math in machine learning and thought I had found my passion in life. 
							The rest of this website is dedicated to a lot of the things I like doing and that make me happy</p>
